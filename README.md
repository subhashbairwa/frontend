            The Employee Management System is a web-based application designed to enhance task management within an organization. It ensures secure authentication, allowing only admins and authorized users to log in. Admins have the ability to create and assign tasks to employees while maintaining full control over task management. Employees can access their personalized dashboard to accept tasks and monitor their progress. The dashboard categorizes tasks into New, Accepted, Completed, and Failed, providing a clear overview of their workload. Each task comes with detailed descriptions to ensure clarity. This system streamlines workflow, improves productivity, and ensures efficient task tracking for both admins and employees.
